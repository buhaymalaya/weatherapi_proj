Using the Open Weather API create a weather application that 
displays the High, Low, Forecast and Humidity using JavaScript.

You will need to get your API from openweathermap.org. Sign up 
for a new account, and you will be given an API key which will 
authenticate and allow you access to the data.

(Creative freedom is encouraged here)

You will possibly need to change the weather data from Kelvin 
to Farenheit using this formula (Depending on the api endpoint 
you are accessing)

(32K − 273.15) × 9/5 + 32 = -402.1°F


Once the project is complete, commit the project to github and 
submit the github repository link to the assignment.

const apiKey = '8f7eb394738f47d02f559c97234911c9';
const apiUrl = `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${location}&appid=${apiKey}`;
